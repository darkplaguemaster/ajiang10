K15 - Sessions Greetings
2020-12-12

- created various variations of error messages depending how the user logged in 
    ex. wrong username, wrong password, no input
- redirect user to different pages depending on their login success
- used session to remember a user's data (even if they refresh the page)
- log out by popping the username from the session
    - redirects user to logout page
    - stays logged out even when page refreshes
- secret key is super important
    - encodes user data 
    - allows sessions to be created
- played with HTML details to make the page more user friendly
    - used value to make a "logout button"
    - changed input type to "password" to hide password visibility 

- in the future: may need to find a way to keep user's information from showing in the url
